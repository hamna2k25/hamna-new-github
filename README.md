# 🐍 Basic Business Python Programs

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates **fundamental Python programs for business calculations**, all presented in a clean HTML interface. It includes **discount calculation, salary computation, and profit analysis**, showing practical applications of Python in everyday business problems.

> **Note:** This project was created using **Clute**, an AI code generation tool. I designed the business problems, selected the inputs, and used Clute to generate the Python code. I then interpreted the results and created the HTML/CSS interface to display the programs clearly.
